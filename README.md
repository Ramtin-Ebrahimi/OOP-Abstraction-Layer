This project demonstrates the integration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with Abstraction to create a scalable and modular software architecture. It showcases how abstraction enhances code maintainability, reduces complexity, and fosters a more structured approach to software design. The project includes examples of abstract classes, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance to illustrate best practices in OOP.  

Key Features:  
- Implementation of abstraction for efficient code management  
- Structured OOP design principles for real-world applications  
- Modular components for reusability and scalability
